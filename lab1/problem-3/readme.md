# Problem 3 - Chrome extension
My chrome extension takes gets a reference to every element on the page and continuously keeps changing the text colour
and the background colour of the element. The colour is chosen randomly from every possible RGB value.
I also randomly change the text to joke text. The joke text is chosen from a list of jokes that I have created.

Text inputs are also change to a random value and random meme sound effects are played on every page click.

Lastly, the font size of the page is also changed randomly.
